#Introduction

This is a repo for a project at Wildhacks 2015, 11/21 - 11/22/2015, at Northwestern University.

The team members are Shayne Hemminger (Louisville), Jon Tan (Waterloo), Jack Wu (Northwestern), and Aditya Dhingra (Purdue).

#####We are building a remote, cloud-streaming camera for mobile viewing. 

###We are using:

- Microcontroller: Particle Photon (Arduino-compatible WiFi development board)

- Camera: Omnivision 7670 camera that is easily Arduino-compatible

- Cloud server: Amazon Web Services EC2

- Mobile development: Android Studio

###The programming languages we use are:

- C, for Arduino/Photon

- Python, 

- Swift, for iOS

###The APIs we are using:

###The prizes we are aiming for include:

- Belvedere's hack that facilitates communication - cloud video throughput can communicate hand signals over the internet

- IBM Bluemix - cloud tool for possibly sending 1 aspect of the process

- Microsoft Azure - cloud tool for possibly sending 1 aspect of the process

- Braintree - take payments to take a picture

- Walgreens - take a picture from the camera and print it 

- Postmates - deliver that picture (to us?)

- Social need - Helping police with mugshots by taking a picture and printing/sending it out???

- Punniest name - "CamerAWS"

###The equipment we have are:

- Many Arduinos (UNO, Mega 2560, Nano, Pro Mini - Jackie, Jon)

- 2 Particle Photons (Jackie)

- Wires and wire cutter (Jackie)

- Other electrical equipment, like breadboards, wires, resistors (Jackie, Jon)

- Cameras like OV7670 with FIFO, without FIFO, and others (Jackie)
